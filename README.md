# NPWD compatibility wrapper for ESX
If you are using the Overextended fork of ESX then this resource is _not required_.


Setup event handlers and export calls to create the player instance within NPWD after an xPlayer has loaded, ensuring correct no-fuss loading and minimal effort.

- Tested with ESX Legacy
- Should work with ESX v1 Final and v1.2
- Completely untested with ESX v1.1 (can't wait)

Like NPWD, this resource is still a work-in-progress and may require alterations to improve support. Currently, you will need to build NPWD yourself from the `develop` branch (the pre-release will _not_ work).
